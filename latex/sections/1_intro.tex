\section{Introduction}
The categorizations of astronomical objects are important in gaining insight into the universe. Classifying these objects accurately is essential for a wide range of astronomical studies and applications. Traditionally, classification models in astronomy differentiate between three primary categories: stars, galaxies, and quasars. However, the complexity of distinguishing among these classes can pose challenges for data-driven approaches, especially when computational efficiency and model interpretability are priorities.

This report evaluates how we can apply binary transformation approaches, such as One-vs-All, to adapt native binary classification algorithms for multi-class classification~\cite{multiclassalgo}.
To address this, we first perform analysis and preprocessing activities, and then compare the performance of the different classification algorithms available in Knime Analytics Platform.
