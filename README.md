# Stellar-ML-Classification
Stellar classification is a fundamental process in astronomy that is used to categorize stars based on their spectral characteristics.
In this study, supervised machine learning algorithms are implemented to solve the stellar classification, which is a multiclass classification problem, using Knime Analytics Platform. Therefore, classification models were developed in order to decide whether an astronomical object is a Star, Galaxy or Quasar. 
To achieve this, the project deals with the class imbalance problem, and the understanding of the most important features, using feature selection approaches. 
The performance is then evaluated to find the optimal classification algorithm that would be used to classify stellar objects.
